# Valheim Degenerator

A WIP tool to delete sectors of Valheim maps. Works with the JSON generated by the [Valheim Save Tools](https://github.com/Kakoen/valheim-save-tools).

Progress:

- [x] read in JSON generated by valheim-save-tools
- [x] extract generated sectors
- [x] extract sectors with player structures
- [x] write image of these sectors
- [ ] extract sectors with terrain modifications ("digg")
- [ ] extract sectors with boss stones?
- [ ] read image back in
- [ ] delete sectors that have been deleted in image
- [ ] write out new JSON
